INSIGHTFUL THINKING
- Word choices for the Contribute part - call them Experiences instead of Stories and Curriculum
- Allow fields for things like the title, images, names of people involved, stuff (articles, materials, things kids made).
- Don't separate stories and curriculum so they have to do less work, and let them upload images
- Better prompts to have people think
- Allow people to include links to curriculum
- Put story field and key elements checkboxes side by side



MULTIMEDIA
- Media collection of people > not just stories but also being able to see the people in action
- Photos on the front that match up to the cultural elements when you arrive at the site



PRIVACY
- Password protect EVERYTHING and email (insert person here) every time someone submits
- Who has the ability to contribute? Password protect it.



POTENTIAL FEATURES
- Maybe feature most recent entries on the front page?
- Add tags
- Allow filtering for experience/stuff
- Make filtering seamless



LITTLE THINGS
- Names vs Name
- Navbar so that you know what page you're on when you're there.
- Display spaces between the elements in story and curriculum view



OTHER
- Social media
